### Example

**Search Query**: site:instagram.com "chatbots" "@gmail.com" OR "@yahoo.com" OR "@hotmail.com" OR "@outlook.com" OR "@aol.com" OR "@icloud.com"
**Max Pages**: 15

This format is a search query designed for use with search engines like Google to find Instagram pages that mention chatbots and contain email addresses from popular email providers (Gmail, Yahoo, Hotmail, Outlook, AOL, and iCloud).

    - site:instagram.com: This restricts the search results to only show pages from Instagram.
    - "chatbots": This searches for pages that contain the word "chatbots".
    - @gmail.com OR @yahoo.com OR @hotmail.com OR @outlook.com OR @aol.com OR @icloud.com: This part of the query looks for pages that mention email addresses from any of these popular email providers.

Putting it all together, this query aims to find Instagram pages that talk about chatbots and list email addresses from common email domains.
